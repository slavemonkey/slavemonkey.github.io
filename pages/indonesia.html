                            <div class="text-white space-y-4">
                                <p>The Indonesian mass killing of 1965-66 was a purge of people affiliated with the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). A series of events and rising tensions between the Indonesian army and PKI culminated in the killing of 500,000 to over 1 million people.</p>

                                <p>Tensions began rising when Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945 as political instability and power struggles followed. President Sukarno rose to power, seeking to unite Indonesia’s diverse and conflicted people, without much success.</p>

                                <p>In the 1950s, the PKI started growing in both membership and influence. As Sukarno sought to cement his rule, he drew support from the PKI in his coalition known as “NASAKOM”; also consisting of the military and religious groups. However, the PKI was seen as potentially existential threat to the military and the largest religious group in Muslims, putting the coalition in direct contradiction. As the 1960s approached, Sukarno started losing power due to economic instability and political factions started mounting their challenges to power. The military, led by General Suharto soon became a strong force. At the same time, however, the PKI were at their peak and actively threatened the lives of many anti-communist individuals. Tensions were high and everyone expected a civil war to begin.</p>

                                <p>On September 30, 1965, a group of junior military officers with alleged links to the PKI staged an attempted coup, now known as the September 30 Movement. Six senior generals were kidnapped and killed. The military and affiliated media blamed the PKI for orchestrating the coup and used this event to stoke hatred and fear against the PKI. The military then initiated a campaign to eradicate communism by dismantling the PKI. This involved first executing the upper leadership, then bringing army units into the streets to hunt down and kill Communists.</p>

                                <p>By the end of the mass killing, power was consolidated under Suharto and he assumed the presidency in 1967. He banned the now-virtually nonexistent PKI, and in tandem with the military, eradicated Communist influence in Indonesia almost entirely.</p>

                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Miscellaneous content from the airgram</h1>
                                    <p>The Jakarta Embassy has received reports about the arrests of several PKI leaders. There is widespread falsification of documents such as alleged confessions – one PKI Politburo member appeared to be unaware of the Politburo’s composition/structure. His remarks are based on the Politburo structure before May 1965.</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>“RJ Martens” is written as one of the intended recipients, originally hidden under a SECRET classification.</p>
                                <p>The airgram includes a list of the status and present whereabouts of PKI (Communist Party) leaders based on all information the Jakarta embassy + State Dept has. Most are captured, dead, or arrested, or under army control. Only one person is reported on the loose (Sudieman). A raw list is on the right:</p>
                                <div class="my-4 py-2 space-y-2">
                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Implication</h1>
                                    <p>The US actively knew of the crackdown: it was in possession of a list of the killings as the situation had already developed. The classified list had detailed information about the whereabouts of everyone. This shows that the US had intimate knowledge of what was happening.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, the U.S. had considered providing aid/weapons covertly, but found it too risky both in chance of success and public backlash. A State Department political advisor asked Ambassador Green what to do in the “reasonable possibility that the Indonesian Army might request our help against a PKI insurgency”. A week later, Green would request the Johnson administration to “explore [the] possibility of short-term one shot aid on covert, non-attributable basis”</p>
                                    <p>Even without directly helping, the U.S. followed the events very closely, and if not for its support, it is probably that the army would never have got the confidence to take power and be so ruthless with the killing.</p>

                                    <p>On the other hand, however, the main basis for the PKI leadership status reports seems to be open-source intelligence: things like the media and army press releases. However, there are also sources like “reliable source” which may suggest insider information.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="my-4 py-2 space-y-2">
                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Conclusion</h1>
                                    <p>The implication of this intervention - or in this case the impact of their actions - is that they were, at a minimum, complicit/stood by and as a result allowed the deaths of hundreds of thousands, as the quiet support from a superpower is pivotal in emboldening such ruthless actions. Also probable is that the U.S. provided this list, and helped the killings became more effective, in this case a clearly negative intervention. </p>
                                        
                                    <p>It is important to note this is not a black and white situation. Many details are still left quite vague, especially pertaining to the sourcing of information, as much of the status report is derived from public sources — this potentially suggests that the U.S. could have low involvement. On the other hand, small parts of the report include insider sources.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The final implication is therefore, given the limited details, that standing by is tantamount to complicity. No matter the level of facilitation, the army had power: all they needed was confirmation that no higher power could stop them.</p>

There is widespread falsification of documents such as alleged confessions, some of which can be easily detected and some not. An example of this is the alleged Njono confession wherein Njono, a PKI Politburo member, appears to be unaware of the composition of the Politburo. His alleged remarks on the composition of the Politburo are based on the Politburo as it existed prior to May, 1965 Central Committee plenum and fail to take into account the promotion of Peris Purdede to be a candidate member of that body or the transfer of Rewang from leadership of the Central Java PKI to the Central Committee Secretariat.</p>

                                    <p>Robert Martens allegedly led a group of State Department and CIA officials to create a list of around 5,000 Communist Party operatives, and provided it to an intermediary of the Indonesian Army. His job was to compile public figures & thousands of people the U.S. wanted dead, then hand over to the army. He would receive the list back with <strong>names ticked off</strong>, designating who was eliminated – captured or killed – <strong>all allegedly</strong>.

                                    <p>The information was all public, but because the KPI didn’t have a public O-chart, it was difficult to tie everything together into a structure. Martens spent his time years before trying to understand the KPI’s organisation by <strong>reading the communist press</strong> and carding the position names.</p>
                                    <p>An aide to Adam Malik – who at this point is high-level and close to the army – came to him for knowledge on the KPI. Martens gave the list to the aide, who gave it to Malik, who gave it to the army. Martens is unsure what effect this had.</p>

                                            "About a month after the coup, a man came to my house who was a chief aide to Adam Malik. Malik had been one of the few leaders who had stood up to the communists and he now became very close to the army. This fellow said, “I have been told by friends in the diplomatic corps, not from Americans, that you know more about the Indonesian communist party than anybody else. So could you help me?” I said, “Sure.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic leading-relaxed text-gray-200 text-md">
                                            So I talked with this fellow at some length, and over time I discovered that he, at least, didn't have, and perhaps the army didn't have, a very organized collection of data on the communist party. Everybody knew the big names … but I had a kind of structure.
                                        </p>

                                            So I gave some of this basic newspaper material to him, and he took it to Malik, and Malik apparently gave it to the army. What effect it had, if any, I don't know. <strong>It was certainly not a death list.</strong>"

                                    <p>Martens believes it was a “means for the non-communists that were basically fighting for their lives” as the situation was precarious before the September 30 coup. In his view, they were in self-defence, fighting off a communist threat to their lives.

                                    The U.S. embassy did help give the Indonesians targets, but Martens questions the level of malice, and emphasises that the information was <strong>public already</strong> – no classified information was handed over. It is a “kill list” nonetheless that likely helped the Indonesian army, but is rather underwhelming, which – according to Martens – grants the giving of the list some legitimacy. Additionally, his perspective that the communists were threatening their livelihoods gives his decision more moral grounding.

                                    Robert Martens provides two stories of witnessing peopleæ being actively threatened by Communists. A young man who was teaching him Indonesian on Sundays: he last saw him when he came to his porch saying that people were out <strong>hunting for him</strong>. Martens walked the man to a bus stop far away, and never saw him again – he believes the man was killed shortly after leaving him. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A professor who had his <strong>life threatened</strong>  by communists, who was fearful that he would never see Martens again. By coincidence, they met again when the situation was bad for the non-communists – the professor broke down crying as he was certain he would be “destroyed” if the communists took power.

                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Implication</h1>
                                    <p>This could be the rationale for people in the US/UK embassy to be indifferent to the killings and be complicit in them, as the communists are seen as a physical, violent threat. The mass killings, to them, may be seen as eliminating the PKI as a threat, and preventing communism from (literally) hurting more people. Earlier in the interview, Martens already establishes that the PKI engaged in widespread violence. Although this is not irrefutable evidence that the PKI were a systematic terror group/threatened people en masse, this would likely have prevented US embassy personnel from being sympathetic to the communists.

                                    <p>This shows that the US’ actions were limited and trivial, and quite innocuous. The implication of the U.S. involvement is more neutral - they were not facilitating the killings, or at most, helped very little. Additionally this reduces the culpability of the international community – they cannot really be to blame.

Airgram A–74 provided new information available since March 1966 on 15 senior PKI figures and listed 4 senior PKI officials reported dead and 20 reported imprisoned. This airgram, which was signed by Green, indicated that: “A sanitized [ie. Embassy attribution removed] version of the lists in A–398 has been made available to the Indonesian Government last December [1965] and is apparently being used by Indonesian security authorities who seem to lack even the simplest overt information on PKI leadership at the time (lists of other officials in the PKI affiliates, Partindo and Baperki were also provided to GOI officials at their request).” (Ibid., RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 12 INDON) Partindo was a small left wing party that was closely allied with larger and more influential Baperki, an association of Indonesians of Chinese descent.”</p>

                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-xl">What the embassy knew</h1>
                                    <p>At the end of October 1965, the Jakarta embassy began to receive “reports of killings and atrocities against PKI members, which were generally reported upon in the context of continued armed PKI resistance.” On October 29, the embassy reported that “Moslem fervor in Atjeh apparently put all but few PKI out of action. Atjehnese have decapitated PKI and placed their heads on stakes along the road. Bodies of PKI victims reportedly thrown into rivers or sea as Atjehnese refuse 'contaminate Atjeh soil.”. The implication is at this point, the U.S. sees this more as a <strong>guerilla conflict.</strong></p>
                                    <p>Gradually, the embassy realised it wasn’t a guerilla conflict, but a PKI purge. On November 13, 1965, it received a report of PKI killing every night in consistent numbers. On February 25, 1966 it noted the death toll at 80,000, with <strong>“no end in sight”.</strong></p>
                                </div>

                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-xl">Overall implication</h1>
                                    <p>Given the context that the US inherently wants to help anti-communists, especially in a guerilla war, in addition to this information that they were uncertain about what was occurring, the U.S. could not have expected the situation to manifest like this. However, the U.S. <strong>did not seem to falter</strong> upon realising that it was a large-scale mass killing. 
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-xl">Conclusion</h1>
                                    <p>The U.S. did provide help to the Indonesian army, just not significant enough to cause escalation. Mostly, the U.S. saw the killings as part of a war, but when they realised, they just silently cheered the army on. The implication of their involvement is first, that bystanding would allow things to escalate dramatically, and second, insignificant help may not be a material advantage, but could possibly embolden the army to be more brutal.

Airgram A–74 provided new information available since March 1966 on 15 senior PKI figures and listed 4 senior PKI officials reported dead and 20 reported imprisoned. This airgram, which was signed by Green, indicated that: “A sanitized [ie. Embassy attribution removed] version of the lists in A–398 has been made available to the Indonesian Government last December [1965] and is apparently being used by Indonesian security authorities who seem to lack even the simplest overt information on PKI leadership at the time (lists of other officials in the PKI affiliates, Partindo and Baperki were also provided to GOI officials at their request).” (Ibid., RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 12 INDON) Partindo was a small left wing party that was closely allied with larger and more influential Baperki, an association of Indonesians of Chinese descent.\”'

With some over-simplification for the purpose of rough identification, they may be described as the Pentagon, the CIA and the State Department. Recognition of the separate military, intelligence, “and political aspects of the American governmental structure is not in itself remarkable. What is striking is the degree to which the Army feels it can keep its relationships with each in separate compartments, and deal with each on a separate plane in isolation from the other two. 3. The relationship with the Pentagon is a friendly, professional association developed at Ft. Leavenworth, Fort Benning and Fort Sam Houston. It is a service-to-service tie between military men which transcends political differences between the governments. It is an association founded on trust, respect, and a network of deep personal friendships. 4. [11 lines of source text not declassified] 5. The Army\'s relations with State have not been extensive. The Army has in the past regarded this manifestation of the American Government as the proper province of the civilian branch of the Indonesian Government. While not regarded as hostile to the Army as such, State is identified in the Army mind with policies and actions inimicable to Indonesia\'s basic national objectives. 6. The Army knows that all three United States governments approve of its actions against the PKI, and that all three are disposed to help the Army in this effort. The basic problem which now confronts it is how this American desire to help can best be exploited, first in the interests of the Indonesian Army, and, second, in the interest of Indonesia. (The Army naturally sees these two objectives as almost identical.)”'

We should get across that Indonesia and Army have real friends who are ready to help. c. When asked for help by Nasution we should respond by saying we are ready to help as they begin tackling their problems in sensible way. d. They will need food, and we can point out that the International Red Cross can supply it, if they find direct help from us or others embarrassing. (Japan, Brazil, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, and even the Republic of Korea have rice.) Raw materials and spare parts for machinery may be needed soon. e. Indonesia’s currency and credit chaos needs immediate expert attention. We can point out that IMF can provide advice and that IMF and Indonesia\'s real friends can provide assistance.

In addition showing Indos we will not take advantage of difficult internal situation to intervene, we recognize probable need for passage of time to allow cooling off period, and will not seek or expect public evidences of pro-American feeling.

Only tenable conclusion we have been able reach after considerable study of available info is that Aidit and PKI were under heavy pressure from Chicoms to produce abrupt and prompt victory for Chicom interests in Asia in view recent setbacks for Chinese in Africa and elsewhere—without, of course, considering Indo interests.”'
