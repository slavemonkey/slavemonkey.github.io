                            <div class="text-white space-y-4">
                                <p>The Indonesian mass killing of 1965-66 was a purge of people affiliated with the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). A series of events and rising tensions between the Indonesian army and PKI culminated in the killing of 500,000 to over 1 million people.</p>

                                <p>Tensions began rising when Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945 as political instability and power struggles followed. President Sukarno rose to power, seeking to unite Indonesia’s diverse and conflicted people, without much success.</p>

                                <p>In the 1950s, the PKI started growing in both membership and influence. As Sukarno sought to cement his rule, he drew support from the PKI in his coalition known as “NASAKOM”; also consisting of the military and religious groups. However, the PKI was seen as potentially existential threat to the military and the largest religious group in Muslims, putting the coalition in direct contradiction. As the 1960s approached, Sukarno started losing power due to economic instability and political factions started mounting their challenges to power. The military, led by General Suharto soon became a strong force. At the same time, however, the PKI were at their peak and actively threatened the lives of many anti-communist individuals. Tensions were high and everyone expected a civil war to begin.</p>

                                <p>On September 30, 1965, a group of junior military officers with alleged links to the PKI staged an attempted coup, now known as the September 30 Movement. Six senior generals were kidnapped and killed. The military and affiliated media blamed the PKI for orchestrating the coup and used this event to stoke hatred and fear against the PKI. The military then initiated a campaign to eradicate communism by dismantling the PKI. This involved first executing the upper leadership, then bringing army units into the streets to hunt down and kill Communists.</p>

                                <p>By the end of the mass killing, power was consolidated under Suharto and he assumed the presidency in 1967. He banned the now-virtually nonexistent PKI, and in tandem with the military, eradicated Communist influence in Indonesia almost entirely.</p>

                                <p>"US Department of State, Airgram A-398 to U.S. Embassy Jakarta, Secret — A document that lists out the status of many prominent PKI members during the height of the massacre.</p>

                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Miscellaneous content from the airgram</h1>
                                    <p>The Jakarta Embassy has received reports about the arrests of several PKI leaders. There is widespread falsification of documents such as alleged confessions – one PKI Politburo member appeared to be unaware of the Politburo’s composition/structure. His remarks are based on the Politburo structure before May 1965.</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>“RJ Martens” is written as one of the intended recipients, originally hidden under a SECRET classification.</p>
                                <p>The airgram includes a list of the status and present whereabouts of PKI (Communist Party) leaders based on all information the Jakarta embassy + State Dept has. Most are captured, dead, or arrested, or under army control. Only one person is reported on the loose (Sudieman). A raw list is on the right:</p>
                                <div class="my-4 py-2 space-y-2">
                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Implication</h1>
                                    <p>The US actively knew of the crackdown: it was in possession of a list of the killings as the situation had already developed. The classified list had detailed information about the whereabouts of everyone. This shows that the US had intimate knowledge of what was happening.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, the U.S. had considered providing aid/weapons covertly, but found it too risky both in chance of success and public backlash. A State Department political advisor asked Ambassador Green what to do in the “reasonable possibility that the Indonesian Army might request our help against a PKI insurgency”. A week later, Green would request the Johnson administration to “explore [the] possibility of short-term one shot aid on covert, non-attributable basis”</p>
                                    <p>Even without directly helping, the U.S. followed the events very closely, and if not for its support, it is probably that the army would never have got the confidence to take power and be so ruthless with the killing.</p>

                                    <p>On the other hand, however, the main basis for the PKI leadership status reports seems to be open-source intelligence: things like the media and army press releases. However, there are also sources like “reliable source” which may suggest insider information.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="my-4 py-2 space-y-2">
                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Conclusion</h1>
                                    <p>The implication of this intervention - or in this case the impact of their actions - is that they were, at a minimum, complicit/stood by and as a result allowed the deaths of hundreds of thousands, as the quiet support from a superpower is pivotal in emboldening such ruthless actions. Also probable is that the U.S. provided this list, and helped the killings became more effective, in this case a clearly negative intervention. </p>
                                        
                                    <p>It is important to note this is not a black and white situation. Many details are still left quite vague, especially pertaining to the sourcing of information, as much of the status report is derived from public sources — this potentially suggests that the U.S. could have low involvement. On the other hand, small parts of the report include insider sources.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The final implication is therefore, given the limited details, that standing by is tantamount to complicity. No matter the level of facilitation, the army had power: all they needed was confirmation that no higher power could stop them.</p>

There is widespread falsification of documents such as alleged confessions, some of which can be easily detected and some not. An example of this is the alleged Njono confession wherein Njono, a PKI Politburo member, appears to be unaware of the composition of the Politburo. His alleged remarks on the composition of the Politburo are based on the Politburo as it existed prior to May, 1965 Central Committee plenum and fail to take into account the promotion of Peris Purdede to be a candidate member of that body or the transfer of Rewang from leadership of the Central Java PKI to the Central Committee Secretariat.</p>

                                    <p>Robert Martens allegedly led a group of State Department and CIA officials to create a list of around 5,000 Communist Party operatives, and provided it to an intermediary of the Indonesian Army. His job was to compile public figures & thousands of people the U.S. wanted dead, then hand over to the army. He would receive the list back with <strong>names ticked off</strong>, designating who was eliminated – captured or killed – <strong>all allegedly</strong>.

                                    <p>The information was all public, but because the KPI didn’t have a public O-chart, it was difficult to tie everything together into a structure. Martens spent his time years before trying to understand the KPI’s organisation by <strong>reading the communist press</strong> and carding the position names.</p>
                                    <p>An aide to Adam Malik – who at this point is high-level and close to the army – came to him for knowledge on the KPI. Martens gave the list to the aide, who gave it to Malik, who gave it to the army. Martens is unsure what effect this had.</p>
                                    <blockquote class=" px-8 py-4 my-4 border-s-4 border-gray-300 bg-[#1f2937] font-light rounded-lg text-left mx-2 space-y-2">
                                        <p class="italic leading-relaxed text-gray-200 text-md">
                                            "About a month after the coup, a man came to my house who was a chief aide to Adam Malik. Malik had been one of the few leaders who had stood up to the communists and he now became very close to the army. This fellow said, “I have been told by friends in the diplomatic corps, not from Americans, that you know more about the Indonesian communist party than anybody else. So could you help me?” I said, “Sure.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic leading-relaxed text-gray-200 text-md">
                                            So I talked with this fellow at some length, and over time I discovered that he, at least, didn't have, and perhaps the army didn't have, a very organized collection of data on the communist party. Everybody knew the big names … but I had a kind of structure.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic leading-relaxed text-gray-200 text-md">
                                            [The information was public in the KPI newspaper, but people may have feared collecting information about it because terror was so great before the coup]
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic leading-relaxed text-gray-200 text-md">
                                            So I gave some of this basic newspaper material to him, and he took it to Malik, and Malik apparently gave it to the army. What effect it had, if any, I don't know. <strong>It was certainly not a death list.</strong>"

                                    <p>Martens believes it was a “means for the non-communists that were basically fighting for their lives” as the situation was precarious before the September 30 coup. In his view, they were in self-defence, fighting off a communist threat to their lives.
