                                    The Kosovo War took place in the late 1990s between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an ethnic Albanian separatist group. Kosovo, a region in southern Serbia, sought independence from Yugoslavia.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The war began in 1998 when the KLA launched attacks against Yugoslav security forces, with the aim of gaining Kosovo independence. Yugoslav forces responded with a brutal crackdown, including widespread human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing, and clear steps that laid the groundwork for a potential genocide.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    International efforts to resolve the conflict, including diplomatic negotiations and economic sanctions, failed to bring about a peaceful resolution. In 1999, NATO launched a bombing campaign, without UN authorization, against Yugoslavia to stop the violence. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The campaign forced Milosevic to withdraw Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, and an interim United Nations administration (UNMIK) was established to govern the region. This remained in place until 2008 when Kosovo declared independence from Serbia. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Although the signs and build-up to a genocide were present, the intervention drove Milosevic and his administration out of Kosovo, and no genocide occurred beyond ethnic cleansing by displacement.

                                    Ethnic Albanians (top) and anti-NATO demonstrators on opposite sides of 42nd Street in New York are kept apart by the police officers, March 27 (3 days after bombing started). The two groups traded insults during the noisy protest in front of New York's Grand Central Station.

                                        There are two crowds in this picture, each on opposite sides of a road. One crowd is waving Yugoslav flags; the other crowd is waving Albanian flags. They are clearly facing each other, positioning themselves at odds with each other. Some in front of each crowd are visibly pointing at each other.

                                        The lower crowd, holding Yugoslav flags, is protesting in opposition to the NATO intervention. This is because it includes many members holding signs saying:

                                        From these quotes from the signs, it is likely that the crowd is protesting in opposition to the NATO intervention. Many of the signs are identical, potentially suggesting that organisers/other people handed them out to demonstrators.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The upper crowd is holding Albanian flags. There are no signs, but it can be inferred that they are either a counter-protest to the anti-NATO demonstrators, or ethnic Albanians (who would most likely support the demonstration), because they are positioning themselves in an organised manner at odds with the Yugoslav flag crowd, and they are holding Albanian flags, and Kosovo Albanians are being persecuted by Yugoslavia.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Additionally, the Albanian side is blocked from the road with metal gates, and police tape is extensively put up to block the protestors. It is unclear whether that is also present on the Serbian side. There is also a heavy police presence on the Albanian side while far fewer officers can be seen on the Serbian side. Assuming that both sides are authorised protests (there is not much police on the Serbian side, and there is established police tape on the Albanian side), it is possible that the Albanians pro-intervention protestors are seen as more of a threat to public order.

                                        This is 42nd Street in New York. New York is known for having a “protest culture” – the largest protests on various global issues often take place in New York. It can be then inferred that public opinion is conflicted on this war: in the place most populated with protests, two contradictory ones are simultaneously occuring.
                                    </p>

                                        Firstly, this picture shows that there were demonstrations for and against the NATO intervention immediately after the bombing started. This picture implies that the public opinion was conflicted, but powerful in either direction: some were heavily in favor, some were heavily opposed (heavy because they cared enough to protest). 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are two equally large groups, one opposing the NATO intervention, the other supporting the NATO intervention, diametrically opposed. It implies that there is a stronger pro-intervention camp compared to other anti-war movements as “pro-war” movements inherently <strong>don’t draw as much vehement support</strong> due to lower levels of emotion. Serbians were leading the anti-NATO demonstration, while Albanians were leading the counter-protest, showing that the most vehement of supporters on both sides were those with a racial/ethnic interest.

                                        People in the West were not unanimously or definitively for or against the international intervention – more conflicted. The Pew Research Center found that in March and April, public support in the U.S. stayed around an eerily constant 60-62%. Nonetheless, opinions were strong on both sides. The key implication here is that <strong>support was divided.</strong>

                                        Due to the history of conflict within the region, the situation is far from settled and the international community must continue to have long-term engagement. Regardless of the severe problems, there are many positive signs – many things have improved since the deployment of KFOR.
                                    </p>

                                        Over <strong>1,300,000</strong> displaced peoples have returned to their homes – 810,000 from Albania and 550,000 internally displaced within Kosovo. Crime has fallen dramatically: Murder rate went from 50 per week to 5 perweek in a year.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>KFOR actively helps the civilian community and the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to overcome the horrors of war and establish the foundations for a peaceful, tolerant, multi-ethnic society in the future. KFOR infrastructure work included clearing over 16,000 homes, 1,165 schools, and ~2,000 kilometres of roads, and distributing over 1 million roofing tiles, 18,000 stoves, 4,000 truckloads of firewood to Kosovar villages. 43,000+ Kosovars have received medical treatment in KFOR medical facilities.</p>

                                        Summary of Section 2: The Remaining Challenges
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The UN Security Council mandates five goals for KFOR. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>First, deterring renewed hostility and threats against Kosovo by Yugoslav and Serb forces – 40,000 KFOR troops in the region act as deterrent.</p>
                                    <p>Second, establishing a secure environment and ensuring public safety and order. KFOR conducts 500-750 patrols per day; however personnel is a problem. Over 100 soldiers are protecting Serb families in Pristina.</p>
                                    <p>Third, demilitarizing the Kosovo Liberation Army. Their fighting capability has been reduced: 10,000 weapons were handed in by December 1999. Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) was created by NATO, to assist in manmade or natural disasters; many former KLA fighters are finding jobs in the KPC. The responsibility still stands on ethnic communities to stand against ethnic division at all levels – this is crucial according to NATO.</p>
                                    <p>Fourth, supporting the international humanitarian effort. KFOR and UNMIK successfully prepared a winterisation program, preventing the threat of widespread suffering, disease and death from winter. There was also progress in reopening the schools, with 300,000 children are being taught in their own language for the first time in a decade. Under Milosevic, speaking Albanian was banned in schools.</p>

                                            <p>A: People say due to insisting any agreement be overseen by NATO, Yugoslavia would never agree. However, Milosevic’s record shows that foreign involvement is necessary as he has repeatedly failed to honor previous agreements. NATO still stood by protecting the rights and sovereignty of Yugoslavia.</p>

                                            <p>A: Yugoslavia had previously violated previous UNSC resolutions The Secretary General was already warning about a lack of intervention. A SC resolution was unlikely to be reached in the near future. Therefore, this was the right thing to do to prevent a humanitarian disaster.</p>

                                            <p>A: NATO ensured the relevance of each target, as well as the distance between target and civilians. Timing was heavily restricted to prevent collateral damage. According to Human Rights Watch (independent), &lt;1% of the 10,000+ NATO strikes led to civilian deaths.</p>

                                            <p>A: This didn’t impact the effectiveness as NATO weapons are almost like God (extremely powerful). Lack of casualties was important to ensure support on the NATO side (apart from the moral reasons).</p>

                                            <p>A: “President Milosevic’s ethnic cleansing in Kosovo was well prepared and rehearsed, as the OSCE/ODIHR report shows.” Later intelligence showed that Milosevic had a pre-planned strategy, named Operation Horseshoe, to drive the Kosovar Albanians out of Kosovo.  The timely response of NATO reduced the effectiveness of this!</p>

                                        According to NATO, the intervention was effective at preventing a genocide and stopping ethnic cleansing. NATO and its interim mission is also making progress at rebuilding the country, one year on. The implication is almost entirely good.

                                    <p>The singer expresses gratitude extremely profusely to the US for their successful intervention. He credits the US for keeping peace, saving lives, “stopping genocide”, and helping the vulnerable underdog (Kosovo). He also shouts out President Bill Clinton.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Overall Implication</h1>
                                    <p class="f font-thin">The singer themself thinks very highly of the US. It is highly likely that this implies that <strong>general public opinion of the US in Kosovo is high</strong>, as the singer is likely an average citizen – this is corroborated given the context that Kosovo has consistently held high approval ratings of the US since 1999 (a 2018 Gallup poll found that 75% of Kosovo citizens strongly approve of the US). </p>
                                    <p class="font-thin">This song provides insight into the general themes of <strong>why Kosovo appreciates America</strong>: stopping <strong>genocide</strong>, and saving Kosovars; additionally, <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> is widely appreciated. The former two is corroborated with logic and real-world events, while the existence of a Bill Clinton statue in Kosovo (as shown in the music video) corroborates the appreciation of Bill Clinton. Love for the US within Kosovo can be dramatic — to the extent of something like this.</p>
                                    <p class="font-thin">This is a conventional piece of Kosovar culture, and it is integrated with gratitude for the West – which is potentially a sign of respect.</p>

                                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Conclusion</h1>
                                    <p>The implication of this is that by intervening in their genocide, Kosovars are extremely grateful - irrespective of the intervention’s success, the people loved it.</p>
