                            <p class="font-extrabold"><strong>"You have just finished your 300-page memoir that documents your life
                            for this academic year. Please write page 217."</strong></p>
    
                            <p>When I saw this prompt around four or five months ago, I had the idea to write something like this. But I put it off, hoping I <em>wouldn't</em> have to write something like this. I hoped my feelings would change later in the year—that I could and would do something about it. Unfortunately, they have not.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are less than 2 months until the end of this academic year. What do I have to show for it?</p>
                            
                            <p>I went on international trips to a "debate" competition that was primarily an entertainment activity—and barely even debate. I still haven't deployed my digital product website to the Internet. I competed in only two debate competitions this year. And I co-organised the Inter-ESF Math Race.</p>
                            
                            <p>Sure, I did some things, but it really feels like I've stagnated. Compared to my progression in Year 9 and Year 10, I don't think this is anything.</p>
                            
                            <p>Maybe it's because I think I'm meant to go on an upward trajectory. My improvement during Year 9 was phenomenal—I went from being extremely mediocre to almost mastering my academic subjects and getting the scholarship. In Year 10, I laid the groundwork for future success: I joined some math competitions and started working on really advanced topics, became part of the best debaters in school and started going to online competitions, <em>almost</em> got a 56, started planning my digital product idea, and became head of the RCHK Truth.</p>
                            
                            <p>And it looks like I haven't really continued beyond the groundwork I laid. I can't tell where the striking differences between Year 10 me and Year 11 me in terms of math—maybe I know a bit more here and there, but the progression hasn't been as drastic.</p>
                            
                            <p>The international trips I went on—for the World Scholar's Cup—happened to clash with every single math competition I could have joined; there haven't been any competitions since November. I went for the national debate team and didn't even receive a trial spot. I trialed for the national public speaking team, arrived at the competition straight after my flight back from NYC (from the World Scholar's Cup), and wasn't even in the top 50% of trialists. The trip to America for the Scholar's Cup wasn't even that great because I <em>spent my time preparing for the public speaking team trials</em>.......</p>
                            
                            <p>I made mistakes in the first couple of months this year with the RCHK Truth—advertised too late, didn't push to find new promising writers, etc. This year's 3D Printing Club college fair stall wasn't as good as I promised myself in January 2023. I signed up for the Science Fair.</p>
                            
                            <p>The only real progression I see is... running. I enjoy it and am glad I improved, but I'm not a gifted runner, nor do I think that's what I should be focusing on.</p>
                            
                            <p>What I want to focus on is maximizing myself where I'm best. I see myself as exceptionally great at math and English writing (although this is something everyone's good at by fifteen; more so, I was good early on). I think I'm able to learn things much more effectively than others. With that, I have expectations for myself. I want to take these things and make the absolute most out of them. Surely, I can't do <em>nothing</em> about me having math abilities better than anyone I've come across in real life. I care about getting to where I want to be, with these aspects.</p>
                            
                            <p>Maybe it's because I thought, back then, if I continued on this upward progression at this pace, I'd have a chance of reaching, say, the top universities. I don't think I do anymore because I can't see the upward progression. Or maybe it's because my goals at the start of the year were somewhat tall orders—national team in either debate or speaking, raise $5,000+ in College Fair, etc.</p>
                            
                            <p>At least I had fun and had great new experiences, right? But no matter how much fun I have, I'll never be at peace knowing that I'm sitting on so much potential and not using it the best way possible. I can really tell this year hasn't been notable because time flew by <em>so quickly</em>. Maybe it was the academic-unrelated events in my life last year, but I think much of it is because I can't tell the differencebetween me in July 2023 and now.</p>
                            
                            <p>I think much of this is due to my lack of initiative. I could've done the overhauls needed to revitalize the RCHK Truth, even though they'd require a time commitment that would massively take away from other places. I could've started my 3D printing club earlier so we would have more time to make everything. I could've gone to more debate competitions, so my CV would be better to prevent getting a trial denied. But also, I don't really know what to do. I've been harboring ideas of bringing back a student-led debate program and making a coding club—but I'm not sure to what end they would be for.</p>
                            
                            <p>But I do have one more chance. I'm participating in the HKIMO selection contest in 21 days' time and plan to seize this opportunity. I have some time left in the school year, and I'm definitely going to seize it.</p>
                            
                            <p>I hope this diary sees better days ahead.</p>
