                        <p class="font-extrabold"><strong>Talk about a personal accomplishment that is unrelated to academics, but that means a lot to you.</strong></p>

                        <p>Christmas of 2022 was quite a significant point in my life. Grades hadn't come out yet but I knew I was locked into at least a 55, with a chance for a 7 in Chinese and guaranteed 7s elsewhere. (I would soon let go of my ambitions for the 56 as Chinese proved to be fruitless.) My first semester with the scholarship had concluded and I was coming off an extremely successful 3D Printing club fundraiser at College Fair. I was really considering getting serious about running. I distanced myself from some and made new friends at the same time—my personal relationships went through a change too.</p>
                        
                        <p>With all of this, I was wondering what would be next.</p>
                        
                        <p>Four days after Christmas, I reached out to an old friend—I'll call him Tyler—who lived close by long ago before I moved at the start of Covid. Tyler was one year older, had just finished his mock exams, and was in a similar situation to mine: not much goals and too much time. As I knew him as a great programmer from before, I asked him how I could start learning programming again—that was one thing I seriously considered as I had stopped learning after August.</p>
                        
                        <p>In response, he asked me if I wanted to start a coding project together, as he had lots of time on his hands as well. Neither of us had any idea of what to make—luckily, he knew of this new piece of software, released just a couple of weeks prior, that could be useful: it was called ChatGPT.</p>
                        
                        <p>Two things were striking about ChatGPT back then. First, it was ridiculously powerful, before ChatGPT went viral and its creators were forced to tame its capabilities. Second, it was ridiculously hard to access. Poe didn't exist at the time, and accounts were only available to people in North America.</p>
                        
                        <p>But we somehow managed to overcome this, and within minutes, we opened a new account. Although ChatGPT wasn't overly inspiring, it did give us initial guidance on choosing a product idea.</p>
                        
                        <p>The following day, on New Year's Eve Eve, Tyler called me at 6 in the morning. He invited me to bike with him all the way from Wu Kai Sha to Tai Mei Tuk, and by 7:30 AM, we got going.</p>
                        
                        <p>The ride was 50 kilometres long. With nothing to preoccupy me but the mostly-familiar scenery, I found myself deep in my own thoughts—specifically, project ideas. It was the perfect catalyst for creativity; nowadays, my go-to activity for creative inspiration is cycling.</p>
                        
                        <p>And then it hit me—I wanted to create an app to generate math questions.</p>
                        
                        <p>My original thoughts were concerned with a synthesized question repository, as I was studying calculus and was so fed up with finding questions that I eventually decided to make my own to solve. But I realised my process of creating questions was really systematic: I'd find the derivative of <em>$4x^7$</em>, then the derivative of <em>$6x^9$</em>—the only difference was randomly generating the coefficient (4 and 6) and exponent (7 and 9). Surely, if a machine did this, it would work just as fine.</p>
                        
                        <p>Unfortunately, Tyler and I decided to create a different product to start—a language exchange application. The main competitors within that market were pretty poor-quality, and we thought we could do better. We did much of the initial planning with the help of ChatGPT (which proved to actually be quite useful) and started designing our user interface.</p>
                        
                        <p>The project turned out to be much more difficult than expected, as we—but especially I—had to learn new programming languages. In the weeks after school resumed, however, we put the project on the shelf, promising to return to it once we had time. We didn't, and never progressed beyond learning the languages and designing a cliche corporate landing page.</p>
                        
                        <p>But I kept learning those languages, especially React.js, and slowly but steadily progressed, waiting until I was confident enough to build my project.</p>
                        
                        <p>One day in June, while I was reading the React documentation during a course at the City University of Hong Kong, my friend told me: "You know all of this is useless, just start your project."</p>
                        
                        <p>At that point, it hit me: I could keep reading the documentation, but chances are, I would never know when I'd be good enough to start. So Istarted planning.</p>
                        
                        <p>At the same time, we were meant to start brainstorming ideas for the Personal Project. (I know this reflection is supposed to be unrelated to academics, but I'd like to think that my project transcends the PP.) It was so convenient—I'd do this for my PP to get both things done in one go.</p>
                        
                        <p>The process was pretty smooth. I now had a hard deadline—December—to finish, and by July, I was designing the website dashboard on Figma. I jumped right into coding the website, and with the revolutionary strategy of googling things along the way, I made significant progress. By late November, I successfully created a question generator—I was on the plane back from ACAMIS Cross Country when the website started successfully generating questions. Not only did I learn three new programming languages, but I was barely familiar with <em>one</em> before this.</p>
                        
                        <p>I obviously didn't stop after the PP ended. I technically did successfully generate questions, but it wasn't very rigorous, was really non-standard, and used bad practices. I therefore learnt a third programming language and interface (Python and Flask), and two database softwares (MySQL and MongoDB) so I could store the questions on a separate database, and use a third party server to generate the questions before sending them over to the main website. That's three different servers—it's getting complex! I also re-designed the user interface with Athan's help—everything is coming together.</p>
                        
                        <p>This website is the first major part to my hopefully more expansive programming-related CV in the future. If you read my Introduction, you'd know how little else I've accomplished this year—I'm really clinging onto this. But more importantly, I started this thing sixteen months ago, and it's finally on the home stretch.</p>
                        
                        <p>I'm set on making this website available to everyone by the end of June.</p>
