                                <p>This was the first year, where as head of the Truth, I (and Andrea) were solely responsible for getting it up and running again. After inheriting the newspaper from Megan last year, we needed to recruit across all departments, and importantly, get the content flowing in.</p>
                                <p>Due to some setbacks involving my trip to Thailand, we got our assembly advertisement slides in late, and as such, could only finalize recruitment by late September. We also chose to not enforce meeting attendance.</p>                          
                                <p>Even though we had the transitory onboarding period last year, what we never really understood was that content and consistent writers—especially good ones—are not to be taken for granted. Three of the main writers last year graduated, and despite the newspaper's high membership, this didn't mean articles were in supply too. With only a few writers left, all young, things started to look precarious.</p>                          
                                <p>This is why as of now, we only published three editions this year. With this position, I crucially learnt—the hard way—that writing talent doesn't come by easily. Scouting for this talent is extremely important for us to do.</p>                           
                                <p>The heartbreaking part about having these kinds of problems is that alumni, staff, and former staff look at the Truth. If the content stops for months, people might stop tuning in and this invaluable connection is lost. We're currently working to bring it back as soon as possible.</p>

                                <h1 class="text-xl font-extrabold">3D Printing Club</h1>
                                <p>The 3D Printing Club—a club that can now be considered a legacy project, as it marked its two-year anniversary in March—has been my pet project, born and raised by me and my best friend Leo since Year 9. Soon, we are to hand the club/project off to younger ones as we get into DP and graduate.</p>
                                <p>Due to several complications, we opened registration and started advertising for club signups late. With this in mind, we were on quite a tight schedule going into our second iteration of the annual fundraiser. Instead of Team Seas, we chose SPCA this time around, and begun planning around late September. We compiled lists of potential items to sell, and club members, as usual, came with their own designs. One new participant had created these nice-looking Skibidi Toilet designs, and we ended up selling one of them.</p>
                                <p>However, I was away for quite a number of weeks due to international trips for debate and cross country; in addition WOW/Emb@rc cut two more weeks from our time schedule. I had to take many measures to ensure things would remain successful, including teaching my sister how to use the 3D printer remotely while I was in Chengdu for ACAMIS.</p>
                                <p>In the end, we once again managed to 3D print everything on our list, with my home printer churning out 7+ items per day. (It broke soon after College Fair and I haven't managed to fix it since.) Right at the deadline, just like last year.</p>
                                <p>Unfortunately, things on the day of College Fair proved to be difficult. We first had trouble entering the fair as the CAS leaders couldn't give us more than three volunteer passes. And it turned out that, as I left my Make It Sell It group to run the stall, people were coming and going and most volunteers only stayed for a short period before running off to enjoy the fair. I was essentially all alone, doing fun salesperson work, but without the exhilarating energy of last year. The addition of arts and crafts activities in the PAC, as well as the College Fair's expansion compared to last year, also meant attention was diverted from us. In the end, we undersold last year by around 300 dollars.</p>
                                <p>Maybe things are just less exciting the second time around, with the hedonic treadmill, after all. Maybe I had high expectations going into our second annual fundraiser—especially on the financial end, because without COVID, there's way more for people to look at. Or maybe there was an invisible cultural aspect I overlooked that meant everyone volunteering actually stayed at the stall to help.</p>
                                <p>But nonetheless, I vividly remember its initial days with the now-departed Mr Ayers, where our enthusiastic small group of seven would bring designs in for us to print. I remember the following academic year with Ms Karthik, where we got serious in the wake of our planned College Fair fundraiser, and we found challenges in the wake of a membership expansion, notably people messing around, our supposed uneconomical-ness with 3D printing, going into rooms without permission, etc.—all of which were shut down by the responsible Ms Karthik. I remember, for better or for worse, desperately trying to find solutions as we fell behind as College Fair approached. I found a solution in Red Door, but a club leader at the time misused the printers, resulting in a massive conflict. We also never told Ms Karthik about Red Door and got into a ton of trouble for that.</p>
                                <p>Next year, I'll be taking a hands-off approach to this club as I plan for it—especially the fundraiser—to carry on in my absence. I'm happy to have built a project from the ground up to call my own and am proud of how far it's come. I'm still going to be involved with it, but now is as good of a time as any time to look back and reflect.</p>

                                <p>I've participated in the Inter-ESF Math Race several times throughout Year 7 to 10. In Year 9, I competed in the Math Race's senior portion, and placed 6th. In Year 10, I joined the competition without a teammate—I was paired with a Year 9 (who I, honestly, carried the entire way). I placed third with quite a satisfying performance, in my opinion. I do remember matching up against this insane South Island School kid, same age, where we went 7-7 in the buzzer round. He won by tiebreaker.</p>
                                <p>But this year, I was too old to participate. Instead, I joined the organising committee, which also included Torres, Aidan, Michael, Jude and Rishabh from Year 12, and Athan from Year 11. We weren't really in charge of specific things—we collaboratively worked on creating all the material for the competition, handling registration, recruiting volunteers, making briefings, etc.</p>
                                <p>Then the day came, which was incomparable to anything I'd experienced before. As we were low on volunteers, I had to both organise and volunteer at the same time. We started with the Dragon Math round, which was incredibly chaotic as three teams had to run back and forth to me for questions and answers. I'm extremely thankful for everyone who volunteered and allowed this competition to succeed in the wake of so much chaos and difficulty.</p>
                                <p>Then, there was a highly problematic buzzer round where we didn't get our power-pairing to work. This isn't really relevant—the bottom line is that after the Junior section's competition was done, I was had barely any gas left in the tank. But there still was the Seniors' section to run.</p>
                                <p>By the end, I was absolutely exhausted. It was incredibly rewarding though—seeing something you poured effort into culminate in 300+ kids having a fun Saturday out with their friends.</p>

                                <p>I continued my journey upwards with debate this year. I went to one online competition in the summer, worked on my skills, and as the summer came to a close, I won a local school tournament with King (although it was quite easy). Then, I competed in the de facto Hong Kong secondary school nationals (known as SDC) with teammates from RCHK. We lost in the quarterfinals to a strong but highly beatable HKIS team, largely due to my crucial mistakes in both speeches. I knew, from here, that I had to work on strategy.</p>
                                <p>I then decided to trial for the Hong Kong national debate team. Coming off a stretch of practice, I was confident I would at least do somewhat well—my craft was coming together at this point, in the nick of time, and I wanted to test my chances. But because I hadn't won/placed well in many competitions, I wasn't given a spot at the trial. So in December, Andrea and I went to this tournament called Diliman Schools BP, where we made it to the semifinals before unfortunately losing from mistakes in, strategy yet again.</p>
                                <p>At this point, most of my training and practice didn't come from school training, but online debate tournaments and resources. I haven't been to any more tournaments—most of them returning to in-person, especially timezone-friendly ones, being a reason. They are also quite mentally exhausting and time consuming as you sit at home, with long periods of intense listening, thinking and speaking, for up to two days on a weekend.</p>                              
                                <p>But I'm planning on going to many more competitions again, to hopefully improve and place well. I'm also looking forward to the national team trials in October—I'm promising to not let myself down.</p>

                                    <p>This year has been phenomenal for my running. I started the Cross Country season slow—with barely any running since the previous school year/Friday Morning Track stopped, I clocked just under 25:00 for the initial 5KM time trial. I went to ACAMIS without much training, and performed pretty poorly in November as I still wasn't very fit. I went to a mini-meet where I missed the start, then Winter break came.</p>
                                    <p>I trained over the break, clocking from 16-24km per week for two weeks—hitting 14km in a single day at one point to break into my new shoes. After running 20.24km with Milo on New Year's Eve and barely making it over the finish line, I went to a mini-meet and placed second-last, although I clearly improved my time.</p>
                                    <p>Then came the Cross Country championships. After receiving suboptimal results for my Term 1 grades, I was determined to put up a good performance this time around. On incredibly hilly terrain, I completed the 4.2km race in 18:44, placing just above the 50% mark of competitors. It was definitely the most difficult thing I had done in Year 11, up to that point.</p>
                                    <p>But this was just the beginning, as the Track and Field season was about to start. I was looking to ride off this high and continue improving—I set a target to run the 1500m in under 5 minutes and 30 seconds. I started running a lot more, hitting from 15-25km per week consistently, much of which was track workouts and long runs (10km+). I saw results in the first mini-meet I went to, where I placed top 10. I didn't get a time, though.</p>
                                    <p>In Athletics Carnival, I placed 4th in U20 for the 1500m. I was fairly sure I'd hit under 5:30 already, despite having no recorded time once again. So I kept training hard to see where I could go. (Side note: I won bronze in the 800m with a time of 2:29, which was pretty nice on the side.)</p>
                                    <p>Then the final championships came. In the last race of the season, I still never got a time for my 1500m, but I'm certain that it was within the 5:10 to 5:20 window. I wasn't feeling great on the day—likely due to stress—but this was a phenomenal result. Estimating it at a 5:15, I beat my goal by 15 seconds. It's now the off-season and I have one more goal to hit: 5km under 20 minutes.</p>
