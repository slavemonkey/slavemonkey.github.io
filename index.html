                                    They were made to answer those questions by speaking into a microphone in open court; soon, both were blindsided as details of their lives ricocheted around the internet. They said they were frustrated that so much attention was devoted to prospective jurors and ascertaining information about them.
                                    
                                    While they later learned that the judge in the case, Justice Juan M. Merchan, had ordered the redaction of some of the information jurors were ordered to reveal publicly, they felt that he had acted too late. As with many things connected to the trial, the rhythms and even some of the parameters are being written in real time.

                                supported to a moderately high extent. The trendline equation is [1. 63x − 25. 5], indicating that for every 1 cm
                                increase in arm length, typing speed increases by 1.63 WPM. Each centimetre of arm length is more significant than
                                each word per minute, as the range of arm lengths is only 55 to 78 cm while typing speed ranges from 61 to 135 WPM
                                (excluding outliers). The same reasoning as the hypothesis is true in that longer fingers is a minor advantage: its
                                benefits of reducing finger movement don’t have a significant impact on typing speed. The trendline’s low gradient is
                                another reason it is unclear whether the trend plateaus, because it is difficult to tell the difference between a small
                                gradient and a plateau.
                                To comment on the reliability of my results, my data is partly reliable. The trendline of the scatter plot has a
                                coefficient of determination (R
                                2
                                ) of 0.159, which suggests a weak correlation. Experiments predicting human
                                
                                behaviours/abilities like typing speed usually have R
                                
                                2 values under 0.5, with 0.2+ being a decent correlation (Neter et
                                al., 1974). This weakens the result of the first part of the hypothesis, that there is a positive correlation – it is
                                supported to a weak extent.</p></div>
